# A simple diffusion model for better understanding of score matching
In this code, we tried to generate the swiss roll dataset, a two dimentional dataset, in order to show the strength of Langevin dynamics and Annealed Langevin dynamics algorithms. With regards to the former, we used a conventional neural network to conduct score matching. As for the latter, a noise conditional neural network was employed to carry out denoising score matching. Finally, these two networks has been separately trained and their corresponding synthetic datasets have been generated. The distributions of original dataset and two newly generated datasets were depicted below, in which we can see that all three distributions are very similar to each other.
